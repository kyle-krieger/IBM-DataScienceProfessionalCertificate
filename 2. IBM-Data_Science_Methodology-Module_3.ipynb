This should include meta data, email subject, email sender, email contents, and a description of the success of the service (i.e. \"service successful,\" \"contacted with no response,\" or \"invalid contact information\")\n\n### **Data Collection**\n\n- Utilize techniques such as descriptive statistics and data evaluation\n\n### **Data Preparation**\n\n- In this step we need to evaluate the different variables of our data in order to undestand it better. For example we would calculate univariate statistics of centeral tendencies such as mean or median and the correlation between variables represented in the Data Requirements stage. \n\n### **Model + Evaluation**\n\n- Lastly we create a classification model, evaluate the outcome and perform the corresponding changes untill we have a sufficent model to answer the client's request.\n\n#### Author: **Kyle Krieger**",
